# Solar-Power-Prediction-of-Nagpur-using-AI
This paper aims to develop a set of deep learning models through feature importance algorithms to predict the DNI data. The proposed models are based on historical data on meteorological parameters and solar radiation properties in a specific location in the region of Nagpur, Maharashtra, from June 18, 2019, to June 18, 2020.
