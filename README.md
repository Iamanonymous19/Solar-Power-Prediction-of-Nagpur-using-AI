# Solar-Power-Prediction-of-Nagpur-using-AI
AIM:  To predict the solar power generation capacity of a location using Machine Learning algorithms and statistical methods.
OBJECTIVES: 
1) To study the given dataset 
2) To build appropriate ML model(s) and train them using the dataset
3) To predict DNI and GHI values using the trained ML model(s)
WORK COMPLETED AS PER OBJECTIVES:
Based on the dataset, three ML models were created and trained using these techniques: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM).
DNI values were predicted via all 3 models and then using these predicted values, GHI values were predicted.
ABSTRACT
Solar radiation can be used for producing heat, causing chemical reactions, or generating electricity. Therefore, the amount of solar radiation at different times of the day must be determined to design and equip all solar systems. In Addition to that, it is necessary to go through the  thorough understanding of different solar radiation components, such as Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI), and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI).
We utilized various machine learning (ML) models for this purpose. This paper aims to develop a set of deep learning models through feature importance algorithms to predict the DNI data. The proposed models are based on historical data on meteorological parameters and solar radiation properties in a specific location in the region of Nagpur, Maharashtra, from June 18, 2019, to June 18, 2020. These predictive models play a crucial role in optimizing solar energy systems by providing actionable insights into solar energy potentials and system enhancements. Through the utilization of these data methodologies, stakeholders in the renewable energy sector can make well-informed decisions, significantly contribute to sustainable energy solutions, and pave the way for a greener future.
